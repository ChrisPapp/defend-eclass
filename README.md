# defend-eclass
Patch security issues in version 2.3 of [open-eclass](https://www.openeclass.org/).

Some of the security issues fixed are:
- SQL Injections
- Cross-site Scripting
- Cross-site Request Forgery
- Remote File Inclusion

Since this is part of a university assignment, we were not allowed to update PHP (e.g. no PreparedStatements) and change server and deployment settings.
